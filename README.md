 ðŸš€ How to Run Your Flutter Project

1. **Open Your Terminal or Command Prompt**  
   Navigate to your Flutter project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/flutter_project
   ```

2. **Ensure Flutter SDK is Installed**  
   Run this to verify Flutter is set up correctly:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```
   Fix any issues shown (especially with Android SDK or emulators).

3. **Get All Dependencies**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Launch an Emulator or Connect a Device**  
   - To start an Android emulator:
     ```bash
     flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>
     ```
     Or use Android Studio to launch one.
   - Or just plug in your physical device with USB debugging enabled.

5. **Run the Project**  
   Run:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

### Optional Commands

- **Run on a specific device** (if multiple are connected):
  ```bash
  flutter devices  # list devices
  flutter run -d <device_id>
  ```

- **Run in release mode** (faster, no debugging):
  ```bash
  flutter run --release
  ```

- **Hot reload** (while running):
  - Press `r` in terminal for hot reload
  - Press `R` for full restart
